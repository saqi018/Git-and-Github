                       What is Git and GitHub

 ### Git:
Git is a software that helps you track and manage changes in your files over time. It is like a version history for your work, so you can always go back to a previous version if something goes wrong.

 ### GitHub:
GitHub is an online hosting server where you can store your Git-managed projects. It allows you to share your code with others, collaborate on projects, and keep everything backed up in the cloud.

In this section, we will learn about the "git add" command for adding files.

### There are three methods for adding files:

1. git add file_one file_two...

   Example: Add specific files such as 
   `git add index.html, style.css, script.js`.  
   Use this command to add only the files you want to include.

2. git add .  
   Example: Use `git add .` to stage all changes in the current directory.  
  

3. git add -A 
   Example: Use `git add -A` to stage all changes in the repository, including changes to files in the current directory and subdirectories.



### Simple Explanation for Each Method:

1.git add file_one file_two...
   This method is like picking specific toys (files) you want to show to your friend (Git).  
   Example: If you want to show `index.html, style.css, script.js`, you write:  
   ```
   git add index.html style.css script.js
   ```

2. git add .  
   This method is like telling Git to look at everything in your current room (folder) and pick up all the toys (files).  
   The command is:  
   ```
   git add .
   ```

3. git add -A
   This method is like telling Git to look at the entire house (project) and pick up all the toys (files) that youâ€™ve changed, added, or even deleted.  
   The command is:  
   ```
   git add -A
   ```
